# About
I've built a tic-tac-toe web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes functions to handle user clicks, track game state, and check for winning conditions. This interactive and engaging game lets users play against each other or against an AI opponent, aiming to get three markers in a row to win.
